  =>   It is a structured Inventory and Order Management System built using the C programming language. The primary objective of the system is:-

	* A simple and efficient Inventory and Order Management System developed in the C programming language.

  * Designed to help manage product stock, handle customer orders, and maintain transaction history.

  * Uses structures, arrays, and modular functions to organize data and operations.

  * The system supports adding new stock items, viewing inventory, placing multi-item orders, and generating summary reports.


The program maintains a list of items, each defined by a unique ID, product name, and available quantity. Managers can add new items to the inventory, view the updated list, and monitor stock levels. Users, on the other hand, can check the available items and place multi-item orders based on their requirements. When an order is placed, the system automatically verifies item availability, deducts the required quantity from stock, and updates the inventory in real time.

A major strength of this project is its structured and modular approach. By dividing the source code into multiple modules and header files, the system becomes easier to understand, maintain, and scale. Each module handles a specific functionality such as inventory operations, order processing, user interactions, and report generation. This improves readability and helps avoid code duplication.

The system also records each successful order, storing details such as the customer name, ordered items, and the allocated quantities. This order history allows managers to track past transactions and understand patterns in stock usage. Upon exiting, the program generates a final report summarizing total orders fulfilled, total units dispatched, and the remaining stock for each item, offering a complete overview of system activity.

Overall, the project demonstrates practical implementation of data handling, structured programming, and modular design in C. It offers a reliable solution for basic inventory control and serves as a strong foundation for more advanced management systems.
